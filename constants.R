HELP_TEXT$summary[6] = 'This plot shows the performance of a studio throughout time.  The y-axis represents percentiles.  The red curve is the performance in terms of number of shows produced.  The blue curve is performance in terms of median score.  When a point is at y = p, this means the studio did better than p*100% of all studios (or did worse than (1-p)100% of all studios).  When \'All studios\' is selected, the interpretation of the plot changes to the performance of the industry.  In this case, when (x, y) = (t, p), this means the industry did better in year t than p*100% of all other years.  The closer to 1.0 a point is, the better the studio or industry performed for the associated year.'
HELP_TEXT$summary[7] = 'This plot shows the same information as the above one, but using different axes.  The x-axis is the proportion of studios that produced fewer anime than the currently selected studio.  The y-axis is the proportion of studios that had lower median scores than the selected studio.  The points are shown as years and separated into quadrants to easily see which years were best or worst for the studio.  The dashed lines intersect at the median performance levels of the studio.  This allows the following interpretations: years in the first quadrant are those in which the studio made more shows and got better scores than usual (the golden years).  Years in the second quadrant are those in which the studio made fewer shows and got better scores than usual.  Third quadrant years are those in which the studio made less shows and got lower scores than usual (the dark ages).  Fourth quadrant years are those in which the studio made more shows and got lower scores than usual.  The years in red are the most recent five years, and those in blue are following years (they cover the most recent decade).  When \'All studios\' is selected, the interpretation changes as in the above plot, so that years in quadrant Q are those in which the industry performed as explained earlier in this paragraph.'
